This app is to developers make your calendar without difficulty.


I spend hours for to do this in a project and I've decided share with the Android community.


So, first we have our item_calendar, it is as the day label will appear inside the calendar view.
You can see layout/item_calendar, our label, You can add anything and change conform your necessity.


The magic happens in the MonthAdapter, this use the and ti populate our RecyclerView and show for us.
